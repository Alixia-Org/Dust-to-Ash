# Dust-to-Ash
### This game is in development. :)

This is a management based game still in extremely early developement. We're planning on adding tons of stuff later. Soon we'll put in stuff like a story line, leveling systems, mobs, exploration, and tons of other features. Please see the Wiki for more details on planned features, or click [this link](https://github.com/Alixia-Org/Dust-to-Ash/wiki/Planned-Features).

_This game will be an economy simulator packed with crap tons of other features, (e.g., deleting your operating syst-) and ~~should have an official site sometime soon.~~ **now has an official site hosted ~~in the repository.~~ on a desktop at my house that definitely won't crash at any given moment! (Now I can run PHP and SQL!)**_

Progress is progress...

### Development

This game is being worked on frequently. Any help is appreciated. Also, I'll try to keep the wiki documeted with all the gameplay and features we plan to add, so you will know what's coming next (or you can add it yourself!...)
