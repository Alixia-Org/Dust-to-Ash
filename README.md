# Dust-to-Ash
## This game is in development. :)

This is a management based game still in extremely early developement. We're planning on adding tons of stuff later. Soon we'll put in stuff like a story line, leveling systems, mobs, exploration, and tons of other features. Please see the Wiki for more details on planned features, or click [this link](https://github.com/Alixia-Org/Dust-to-Ash/wiki/Planned-Features).

_This game will be an economy simulator packed with crap tons of other features, (e.g., deleting your operating syst-) and ~~should have an official site sometime soon.~~ **now has an official site hosted in the repository.**_

## How you can help!

If you think this game should have something added to it or some code needs fixing (or really anything else) and you are able (and willing) to add/fix it, feel free to fork the repo or create a pull request to do so. Any help is appreciated.
If you feel like something should be added but don't want to add it yourself, feel free to ask us about it. If we like it, we'll add it to the [planned features page](https://github.com/Alixia-Org/Dust-to-Ash/wiki/Planned-Features) in the wiki (and then to the game as well).
